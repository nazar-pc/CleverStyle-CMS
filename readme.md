# What is this?

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/nazar-pc/CleverStyle-CMS](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/nazar-pc/CleverStyle-CMS?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

CleverStyle CMS is simple, scalable, and fast content management system.

System core contains only basic functionality, so, it looks more like CMF (content management framework) rather than CMS.

But in parallel with core some components are developed:

#### Modules

 * **Blockchain payment** (payment method using Bitcoin as cryptocurrency and API of blockchain.info)
 * **Blogs** (simple blogging functionality)
 * **Comments** (adds comments functionality to other modules)
 * **Composer** ([Composer](https://github.com/composer/composer) integration into CleverStyle CMS, allows to specify composer dependencies in meta.json that will be installed automatically)
 * **Content** (simple content functionality. May be used by other components or stand-alone)
 * **Cron** (provides GUI for crontab, scheduled tasks)
 * **Deferred tasks** (Deferred tasks allows other components to create tasks, that can be executed not immediately, but little bit later)
 * **Disqus** (Integration of Disqus commenting service, adds comments functionality to other modules)
 * **Feedback** (simple feedback module, sends message to admin's email)
 * **Http server** (Http server based on [React](https://github.com/reactphp/react), potentially consumes less memory and works much faster that mod-php5 and php-fpm (and even pure HHVM too))
 * **HybridAuth** (integration of [HybridAuth](https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth) library for integration with social networks and other services)
 * **OAuth2** (provides realization of OAuth 2 authorization protocol (server side))
 * **Photo gallery** (simple photo gallery module, powered by Fotorama, Plupload and SimpleImage components)
 * **Plupload** (integration of [Plupload](https://github.com/moxiecode/plupload) for files uploading, adds files uploading functionality to other modules)
 * **Polls** (provides polls functionality to other modules)
 * **Shop** (provides simple, but highly extensible and customizable shopping functionality)
 * **Static pages** (allows to create static pages like About page or pages without interface, for example for site owner verification)
 * **WebSockets** (support for WebSockets connections utilizing [React](https://github.com/reactphp/react) and [Ratchet](https://github.com/ratchetphp/Ratchet))

#### Plugins

 * **Composer assets** (Bower and NPM packages support through Composer)
 * **Fotorama** (integration of [Fotorama](https://github.com/artpolikarpov/fotorama) jQuery gallery into CleverStyle CMS)
 * **Json_ld** (simplifies some parts of JSON-LD generation)
 * **Picturefill** (integration of [Picturefill](https://github.com/scottjehl/picturefill) polyfill into CleverStyle CMS)
 * **Prism** (integration of [Prism](http://prismjs.com/index.html) syntax highlighter into CleverStyle CMS)
 * **SimpleImage** (integration of [SimpleImage](https://github.com/claviska/SimpleImage) class into CleverStyle CMS)
 * **Tags** (currently contains single trait, is used by other components in order to avoid code duplication)
 * **TinyMCE** (integration of [TinyMCE](https://github.com/tinymce/tinymce) WYSIWYG Editor for providing simpler content editing)

#### Themes

 * **DarkEnergy** (Dark theme used on CleverStyle.org)
 * **Tenebris** (Another dark theme designed by Dmitry Kirsanov)

# Why?
There are thousands of other CMS and CMF, that is true, but this one is different from many because of ideas that lies in development.

### Simple
Really simple.

There is no need to make it more complicated, add more abstractions that is necessary, or write code to support some architecture.

Install only what you really need, write only code that you'll really use.

### Standalone
System contains everything necessary inside to ease setup and to be independent from outside uncontrolled services.

No CDNs for JS and fonts in system core, no composer, bower or any other packages needed to be installed from command line.

Just take SINGLE installation file, and open it from web browser or run from command line to install system.

However, if you add some composer packages to your project - system will understand that and all your packages become available immediately in any place of system.

### Working
Fresh system just works.

Reasonable defaults allows you to use all system capabilities out of the box.

There is no need to configure cache, storages, anything else.

You can start from default, and when you're ready - you can switch to another cache engine, storage engine, add another database, or redefine almost every aspect of System.

You can do that at any time, keeping possibility of system upgrade.

But prior to that moment you do not need to change anything - it will work just fine.

### Customizable
You can subscribe to some events in system and do some operations at the same time or change default flow of things as needed.

You can redefine how it looks to any imaginable extent.

You can write code in any style you like, there are recommendations how to do that, but actually you do not forced to create classes on any small stupid thing, or avoid classes when you want them to be.

You can!

### Small
System core in extracted form have around 1.8 MiB (distributive file is up to 400 KiB), that is comparable to other projects that are called just "libraries".

There are no huge list of external dependencies, there are no external dependencies at all.

Nevertheless, system includes a set of thirdparty components inside to make system complete and in order to not reinvent a good wheel.

### Clean
System track all files, DB tables and other things created in result of components functioning.

This means that if you installed some component, used it for a year, and then completely remove - system will be exactly in the same state as before installation.

This results in constant and predictable performance (no degradation with time), efficient disk space usage (no forgotten files, cache items, configs and stuff like this) and full control over system state.

# How to try?

It is possible to try latest git version of CleverStyle CMS without even installing it using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), just type in terminal:
```bash
$ docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 nazarpc/cleverstyle-cms
```
And go to `http://localhost:8888`, sign in using login `admin` and password `1111`.

`--rm` means that container will be removed after stopping (you can stop it with `Ctrl+C`).

If you want to play with live system - attach volume to container:
```bash
$ docker run --rm -p 8888:8888 -v /some_dir:/web nazarpc/cleverstyle-cms
```
Now in `/some_dir` you'll have source code of CleverStyle CMS from container which you can edit as you like and it will reflect on demo.
